# Welcome, User

mountebank is the only open source service virtualization tool that competes with the commercial offerings
in terms of protocol diversity, capability, and performance. Here's what
[Capital One wrote](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/moving-one-of-capital-ones-largest-customer-facing-apps-to-aws-668d797af6fc)
about their mobile cloud migration (emphasis theirs):

At the moment, the following protocols are implemented, either directly in the tool or as a community extension:
* http
* https
* tcp (text and binary)
* smtp
* ldap
* grpc
* websockets
* graphql
* snmp
* telnet
* ssh
* netconf

mountebank supports mock verification, stubbing with advanced predicates, JavaScript injection,
and record-playback through proxying.

See [getting started](http://localhost:2525/docs/gettingStarted) guide for more information once you have it running locally.

## Install and Run

Install:

    npm install -g mountebank

Run:

    mb

There are a number of [command line options](http://localhost:2525/docs/commandLine) if you need
to customize mountebank.

All pre-release versions of mountebank are available with the `beta` [npm tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mountebank).
No `beta` version is published unless it has passed all tests.

## Learn More

After installing and running, view the docs in your browser at <http://localhost:2525>.

You can always learn more and support mountebank development by buying the book:

## Building

There are two packages: mountebank itself, and a test package called mbTest (which houses all
out-of-process tests against mountebank). First ensure all dependencies are installed for both packages:

    npm install

Then, run all tests:

    npm test

Several other test configurations exist. You can see the CI pipeline in .circleci/config.yml.

There are some tests that require network access.
A few of these tests verify the correct behavior under DNS failures.  If your ISP
is kind enough to hijack the NXDOMAIN DNS response in an attempt to allow you to conveniently peruse their
advertising page, those tests will fail.  I suggest that, under such circumstances, you talk to your ISP
and let them know that their policies are causing mountebank tests to fail. You can also set
the environment variable `MB_AIRPLANE_MODE=true`, which will avoid tests requiring your DNS resolver.
